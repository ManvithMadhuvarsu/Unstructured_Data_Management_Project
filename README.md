Unstructured Data Management Using Natural Language Processing

This repository contains code and resources for building a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to access unstructured data without converting it into structured. 
**Key Features**:
  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
  Feature Engineering
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Model Training and Evaluation
  Data Processing Pipelines
  Data Quality Monitoring
  Custom Data Cleaning Functions
  Report Generation
